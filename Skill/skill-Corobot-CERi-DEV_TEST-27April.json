Think about how you can stay in touch with friends and family via telephone, video calls or social media instead of meeting in person – whether it’s people you normally see often or connecting with old friends.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Help and support others:</strong> Think about how you could help those around you – it could make a big difference to them and can make you feel better too. Could you message a friend or family member nearby? Are there community groups that you could join to support others locally? Remember it’s important to do this in line with guidance on coronavirus (COVID-19) to keep yourself and everyone safe. And try to be accepting of other people’s concerns, worries or behaviours.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Talk about your worries:</strong> It is quite common to feel worried, scared or helpless about the current situation. Remember that this is a difficult time for everyone and sharing how you are feeling and the things you are doing to cope with family and friends can help them too. If you don’t feel able to do that, there are people you can speak to via NHS recommended helplines or you could find support groups online to connect with.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Look after your physical wellbeing:</strong> Your physical health has a big impact on how you are feeling emotionally and mentally. At times like these, it can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, drink enough water, exercise inside where possible and outside once a day, and try to avoid smoking, alcohol and drugs.\n<br />\n<br />\nIf you are able to go outside, consider walking or gardening (keeping the recommended 2 metres from others as outlined in the social distancing guidance). If you are staying at home, you can find free easy 10 minute work outs from Public Health England or other exercise videos to try at home on the NHS Fitness Studio. Sport England also has good tips for keeping active at home.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Look after your sleep:</strong> Feeling anxious or worried can make it harder to get a good night’s sleep. Good-quality sleep makes a big difference to how you feel mentally and physically, so it’s important to get enough.\n<br />\n<br />\nTry to maintain regular sleeping patterns and keep good sleep hygiene practices – like avoiding screens before bed, cutting back on caffeine and creating a restful environment. The Every Mind Matters sleep page provides practical advice on how to improve your sleep.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Try to manage difficult feelings:</strong> Many people find the news about coronavirus (COVID-19) concerning. However, some people may experience such intense anxiety that it becomes a problem. Try to focus on the things you can control, including where you get information from and actions to make yourself feel better prepared.\n<br />\n<br />\nIt is okay to acknowledge some things that are outside of your control right now but constant repetitive thoughts about the situation which lead you to feel anxious or overwhelmed are not helpful. The Every Mind Matters page on anxiety and NHS mental wellbeing audio guides provide further information on how to manage anxiety.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Manage your media and information intake:</strong> 24-hour news and constant social media updates can make you more worried. If it is affecting you, try to limit the time you spend watching, reading, or listening to media coverage of the outbreak. It may help to only check the news at set times or limiting to a couple of checks a day."

Find a credible source you can trust such as GOV.UK, or the NHS website, and fact check information that you get from newsfeeds, social media or from other people.\n<br />\n<br />\nThink about how possibly inaccurate information could affect others too. Try not to share information without fact-checking against credible sources.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Think about your new daily routine: </strong>Life is changing for us all for a while. Whether you are staying at home or social distancing, you are likely to see some disruption to your normal routine.\n<br />\n<br />\nThink about how you can adapt and create positive new routines – try to engage in useful activities (such as cleaning, cooking or exercise) or meaningful activities (such as reading or calling a friend). You might find it helpful to write a plan for your day or your week.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Do things you enjoy:</strong> When you are anxious, lonely or low you may do things that you usually enjoy less often, or not at all. Focussing on your favourite hobby, learning something new or simply taking time to relax indoors should give you some relief from anxious thoughts and feelings and can boost your mood.\n<br />\n<br />\nIf you can’t do the things you normally enjoy because you are staying at home, try to think about how you could adapt them, or try something new. There are lots of free tutorials and courses online and people are coming up with innovative online solutions like online pub quizzes and streamed live music concerts.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Set goals: </strong>Setting goals and achieving them gives a sense of control and purpose – think about things you want or need to do that you can still do at home. It could be watching a film, reading a book or learning something online.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Keep your mind active:</strong> Read, write, play games, do crossword puzzles, sudokus, jigsaws or drawing and painting. Find something that works for you.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Take time to relax and focus on the present: </strong>This can help with difficult emotions, worries about the future, and can improve wellbeing. Relaxation techniques can also help some people to deal with feelings of anxiety. For useful resources see Every Mind Matters and NHS’ mindfulness page.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>If you can, once a day get outside, or bring nature in: </strong>Spending time in green spaces can benefit both your mental and physical wellbeing. If you can’t get outside much you can try to still get these positive effects by spending time with the windows open to let in fresh air, arranging space to sit and see a nice view (if possible) and get some natural sunlight, or get out into the garden if you can."

Stay in touch with family and friends over the phone or on social media. There are also sources of support and information that can help, such as the Every Mind Matters website. Think about things you can do during your time at home. People who have not minded staying at home for a week have kept themselves busy with activities such as cooking, reading, online learning and watching films. If you feel well enough you can take part in light exercise within your home or garden. Many people find it helpful to remind themselves why what they are doing is so important. Hopefully, none of your family will suffer more than flu-like symptoms. But some people are badly affected by coronavirus, and particularly the elderly and those with certain medical conditions. By staying home, you are protecting the lives of others, as well as making sure the NHS does not get overwhelmed."

So far, reports suggest the drug has been tested in 340 individuals in Wuhan and Shenzhen and in March 17 reported a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment. A separate study, published April 8, compared favipiravir to another flu drug, umifenovir (Arbidol). In the randomized, controlled study of 240 people, favipiravir did not help people recover faster compared to umifenovir. However, favipiravir did significantly shorten the time that people had fevers or coughs, the study found."

Fourteen days is the incubation period for coronavirus; people who remain well after 14 days are unlikely to be infectious.\n<br />\n<br />\nAfter 7 days, if the first person to become ill feels better and no longer has a high temperature, they can return to their normal routine. If any other family members become unwell during the 14-day household-isolation period, they should follow the same advice - that is, after 7 days of their symptoms starting, if they feel better and no longer have a high temperature, they can also return to their normal routine.\n<br />\n<br />\nShould a household member develop coronavirus symptoms late in the 14-day household-isolation period (for example, on day 13 or day 14)  <b>the isolation period does not need to be extended, but the person with the new symptoms has to stay at home for 7 days</b>. The 14-day household-isolation period will have greatly reduced the overall amount of infection the rest of the household could pass on, and it is not necessary to restart 14 days of isolation for the whole household.

But the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread and infect vulnerable individuals in wider society.\n<br />\nSchools, and all childcare providers, are therefore being asked to continue to provide care for a limited number of children - children who are vulnerable, and children whose parents are critical to the Covid-19 response and cannot be safely cared for at home.\n<br />\nVulnerable children include children who are supported by social care, those with safeguarding and welfare needs, including child in need plans, on child protection plans, ‘looked after’ children, young carers, disabled children and those with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help\" target=\"_blank\">education, health and care (EHC) plans</a>.\n<br />\nPlease, therefore, follow these key principles:\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li>If it is at all possible for children to be at home, then they must be.</li>\n<li>If a child needs specialist support, is vulnerable or has a parent who is a critical worker, then educational provision will be available for them.</li>\n<li>Parents should not rely for childcare upon those who are advised to be in the stringent social distancing category such as grandparents, friends, or family members with underlying conditions.</li>\n<li>Parents must also do everything they can to ensure children are not mixing socially in a way which can continue to spread the virus. They must observe the same social distancing principles as adults.</li>\n<li>Residential special schools, boarding schools and special settings continue to care for children wherever possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nYou can find more information on this topic on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision\" target=\"_blank\">UK Government</a> website."
